title: Net Neutrality, the FCC, and Your ISP
description: or why dismantling net neutrality will make your deplorable internet service worse
---

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-to-2 to advance a proposal that allows internet service providers (ISPs) to provide tiers of service to content providers (e.g. Google, Netflix, Facebook, etc) to their customers. This is a gross expansion of power to companies who are out of touch with their customers, raise prices that are already unreasonably high for subpar services, and squander that money to line their own pockets rather than serve their customers. Monopolistic companies will raise prices to the point that maximizes their profits while trying to minimize costly investments that would improve their lagging infrastructure. Now that these companies have exerted their monopolistic power over consumers who currently has little choice but to accept their meager internet services, they are looking for new revenue streams that will further degrade people’s experience on the internet.

In the nation that literally invented the internet, the United States not only abysmally ranks [31st in download speeds](http://theweek.com/article/index/257404/why-is-american-internet-so-slow), internet subscribers in the U.S. pay more for shoddier internet service than other countries. For example, New Yorkers pay $70 for phone, television, and internet, twice as much as residents of Seoul, Korea, but for [less than 1/6th of the internet speeds](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/28/the-price-of-internet-is-too-high/). New America Foundation’s [Cost of Connectivity](http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_cost_of_connectivity_2013) report contains several more examples of U.S. telecommunications services lagging behind other developed countries. In Chattanooga, TN, subscribers to the public ISP can pay the same $70 as New Yorkers but experience over 20x the internet speed.

U.S. citizens are dealing with more than just overpriced, inadequate service, but ISPs also deceive their consumers and the general public. Vox reports how the National Cable Telecommunications Association (NCTA) is trying to use [misleading infographics](http://www.vox.com/2014/5/12/5711082/big-cable-says-broadband-investment-is-flourishing-but-their-own-data) that suggest that broadband investment are increasing.

However, this graph not only misleads by showing cumulative investments so that the numbers can only go up, but it also misleads by using figures for four-year ranges except for the last figure where it uses a five-year range, deceptively inflating the growth.

The next graph shows the NCTA's own data without using deceptive tactics by showing the actual amount invested in each time period.

The amount invested in the 2009-2013 time range has decreased from the previous time range even though it has a five-year time span compared to the greater amount invested in the four-year time span 2005-2008.

One of the reasons for lagging broadband investments is the belief that our telecommunications infrastructure is already fast enough and does not need to get any faster. Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen states that ["[m]ost websites can't deliver content as fast as current networks move"](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/6/4400382/comcast-google-fiber-gigabit-broadband-internet). This idea seems very inconsistent with Comcast's actions. Comcast insisted that Netflix pay Comcast so that Comcast subscribers can reach Netflix's content and blamed content providers ["were trying to shove too much data through too small a pipe"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/business/media/comcast-and-netflix-reach-a-streaming-agreement.html). So not only do subscribers have to pay ISPs for subpar internet services, these ISPs are now turning around to content providers and charging them to make sure that their content can reach internet subscribers that want their content.

This is a glimpse into what the FCC is voting to promote. It would grant ISPs the power to charge content providers the privilege to provide their content to subscribers who are already paying the ISP to access the internet. Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC ["guaranteed a baseline of service and that the agency would beef up enforcement of companies that strike deals that are harmful for consumers or anti-competitive"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/15/fcc-approves-plan-to-allow-for-paid-priority-on-internet/) in light of the recent vote to dismantle net neutrality. But the "baseline of service" is unsatisfactory as it is already overpriced and mediocre as ISPs like Comcast and Time Warner Cable [continue to score low in customer satisfaction surveys](https://consumersunion.org/news/comcast-and-time-warner-cable-score-low-on-latest-consumer-reports-customer-satisfaction-survey/). Their natural monopoly does not need an additional power to charge content providers and make it more expensive to provide desirable content on the internet. The "baseline of service" that Wheeler is promising that will continue is insulting, and the dismantling net neutrality will only degrade the internet.
