In the market for a smartphone.

Planning to develop for smartphone users.

I remember when I used my fiancee's (girlfriend's at the time) smartphone for the first time. I was absolutely lost. I felt how I imagine my mother must have felt when I saw her use a computer her first few times. I am a software developer, and I took human-computer interaction courses in college, so I placed myself in the place of a designer and managed to figure things out relatively quickly. I get worried, sometimes, because I hear concerns about people becoming [hooked into their mobile devices](http://sirupsen.com/iphone/) and lose some ability to handle themselves in a non-digital context. For example, when a dinner conversation starts to die down, some people start to pull out their phones. I think there is worth in not having that option and practice one's ability to entertain others and have interesting conversations.
